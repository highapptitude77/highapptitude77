The purpose of this repo is to demonstrate my progress in learning scripting language bash & Powershell.
I'm acquiring these skills to increase my chances in finding my role as Cyber-Ops professional.
In Ops 201 I learned that automating tasks and understanding systems and tools that allow you to work remotely provides a huge advanatage over potential competition. Learning to work in the terminal was my favorite part of the Ops Challenge assignments. I never worked in the terminal before and just practicing each day makes me feel like I'm on my way to actually becoming a hacker. My favorite part by far was learning to write scripts and create functions for repeat tasks. Learning to discover different tweaks in script writing makes me feel like I'm starting to actually know what I'm doing.
Shell scripting can be applied to any repeat tasks or reports the man advantage overall would be efficiency. I would continue to improve my ability to write differenc types of automation scripts that perform a list of commands. Like one command that encompasses multiple complex tasks to be executed.
One aspect I'm looking to continously expand my baseline knowledge of scrip writing. I want to learn to write scripts on my own without having to lookup multiple examples and or watch videos. I want the script writing concepts / schemes to become second nature for me.
